## Personal tracking app

URL: https://reflekt-trackr.herokuapp.com/

### Purpose: 
To learn by doing - develop a full stack CRUD web application using the following technologies:
* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript
* Node
* Express
* MongoDB / MongoDB Atlas (Cloud)

* Heroku (deployment)

The project adheres to the MVC file structure (Models, Views, Controllers) and has been designed for *mobile devices*

### Features:
1. User authentication
2. Session management
3. CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete
4. Add (/edit/delete) habits to track
5. Track them weekly with a simple interface
6. See a longer term snapshot for each habit

### More features I'd like to add
1. Category wise view
2. Combined snapshot of all habits
3. Edit functionality for previous weeks

#### Bugs/open issues
Promise doesnt resolve when logging in the week hence to populate the weekly tracker view and breaks, however, on refresh it loads fine
